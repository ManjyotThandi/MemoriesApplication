redux work flow

from index.js create store with all reducers
from inside of app.js useeffect call dispatch(action) for posts
action calls on reducer

now to access this global state inside our components use useSelector in respective component

also redux thunk is used inside of action to use async await


// JUST GOT actions to work and console log it
